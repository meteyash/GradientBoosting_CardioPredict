# GradientBoosting_CardioPredict
*Project Title: Predicting Cardiovascular Disease Using Gradient Boosting Machine Learning*

*Description:*
In this project, I applied Gradient Boosting, a powerful machine learning technique, to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals based on a set of health-related features. The primary aim was to develop a robust predictive model that could aid in identifying individuals at risk of cardiovascular events, thus enabling early intervention and personalized medical care.

*Key Contributions:*
- *Dataset Selection and Preprocessing:* Curated a comprehensive dataset containing demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements of individuals. Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, standardizing features, and detecting outliers.

- *Feature Engineering and Selection:* Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to identify relevant features for cardiovascular disease prediction. Engineered new features, such as risk score aggregates, to capture complex relationships within the data.

- *Gradient Boosting Model Implementation:* Implemented the Gradient Boosting algorithm, specifically XGBoost or LightGBM, to build a predictive model. Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.

- *Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics:* Evaluated the model's predictive performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). Utilized techniques like cross-validation to assess the model's robustness.

- *Feature Importance Analysis:* Employed techniques like feature importance plots or SHAP values to gain insights into the factors contributing most significantly to the prediction of cardiovascular disease. This analysis provided interpretability to the model's decisions.

- *Visualization of Results:* Created visualizations to illustrate the model's predictions, showing how it categorizes individuals into different risk groups. These visualizations helped convey the potential clinical impact of the model.

- *Deployment and Interpretability:* [Optional] Developed an interactive web-based interface to allow healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive risk predictions. Ensured the model's outputs were presented in an understandable and actionable format.

*Results:*
